### To use a custom character sheet in an existing game:
1. Go to a Campaign's/Game's Details Page.
2. Click the Settings-button, and select Games Settings.
3. On the Game settings page, you select "Custom" from the Character Sheet Template menu.
4. If you want to use char sheet code that made prior March 2021, check the box for Legacy Sanitization. If you leave it unchecked, you can use code compatible with the Character Sheet Enhancement Update.
5. The editor has four tabs: HTML Layout, CSS Styling, Translation, and Preview.
    You copy your HTML and CSS to their respective tabs, and if the sheet has translation files, you copy the content of the default translation file(usually English), or for the language you want.
